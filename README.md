# BricRumble
A remake of the classic Arkanoid, written in under a month by 4 university students.

Project configured for CodeBlocks 16.01. It uses SDL2 along a few extension libraries, SDL_Mixer for audio and SDL_Image for graphics. All used assets (sounds, sprites, and other resources) are properties of their rightful owners. If facing any compilation issues, make sure the standard is set to at least C++11. The videogame was created as part of the final project for a course on Object-Oriented Programming, Fall '17 Habib University. I acknowledge the fact that there are a few loopholes and inefficiencies in the code, but just putting this up here for everyone to see/contribute.

A game by:

Osama Yousuf, 
Amin Shiraz Gillani, 
Syed Sameer Nadeem, 
Minhaj Ahmed Moin.

## Compiling and Development
This Project was made using CodeBlocks 16.01 and SDL2.0 with SDL2_image and SDL2_mixer libraries. Go to [LazyFoo's Tutorial](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/) for help with setting up SDL2 for development. You can also use CMAKE for your builds, but since we didn't know about it at that time, we didn't include any makefile.
